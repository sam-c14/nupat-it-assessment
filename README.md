# Getting Started with the Home Page 
 I seperated my code into assets/images for all images or icons which were exported from Figma and used in the code and Had a directory called components which were used to build the home page and then a pages directory which had the Home page file, My Components were seperated into general and cards, the card directory held all the cards design that were used in the home page, I seperated the code into components and pages to make it easier to manage the code and also to make debugging less tasking, I used tailwind css as the css framework to develop the homepage which made development easier and faster, My major challenge was during deployment as babel kept throwing back errors of the image files being too large and over the preset size of 500kb after troubleshooting the problem, making some researches, I tried to eject the react scripts and configure babel and linting form sratch but that was too tedious, Thankfully I had already uploaded the code to my github so I just downloaded the zip and continued from where I left off, How I later solved the issue was by using react-app-rewired as a dependency and customize cra to set the limit of file size which babel is allowed to check and then override the limit and also prevent babel from checking files in the assets/images directory, all this was done in the config-overrides.js file and so had to update the react-scripts to react-app-rewired for it to work in development and production.
